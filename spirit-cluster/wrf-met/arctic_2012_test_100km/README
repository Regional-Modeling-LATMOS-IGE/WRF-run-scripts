#---- Instructions for running a WRF4 meteorological-only Arctic simulation on SPIRIT
#
# Louis Marelle, 2022/03/21
#

# This runs a low-resolution (100 km) quasi-hemispheric Arctic WRF simulation
# for 2012-01-01 to 2012-01-05

# WRF is the Weather Research and Forecasting model. It is a 3D, limited-area
# (regional) model used for weather forecasts, weather hindcasts, and long-term
# regional climate projections.
#
# For more info on WRF, 
# https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/
# For an introduction to the model,
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzSu-343b-0
#
# The WRF model is run in 3 steps. First, WPS (the WRF preprocessing
# system), then real.exe (program creating the main wrf input and boundary
# files), then wrf.exe (the WRF model). How to run these programs is explained
# below.
# 
# Before running this test, the WRF model and WPS need to be compiled (see
# instructions in ../../compilation/), or a compiled version of the model needs
# to be copied to your own space.
# I also recommend going through the WRF online tutorial before running this
# test, to better understand how the model works

Create a directory for WRF output on your /data/ space
mkdir /data/$(whoami)/WRF
mkdir /data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT

Create a directory for the WRF run on your home. Setup files, namelists
and scripts should be kept in a new folder for each run and kept after the run,
so that the run is reproducible later and the setup is documented. It is better
to keep then on your home ~/ since it is backed up, /data/ is not.
mkdir ~/WRF
mkdir ~/WRF/runs
mkdir ~/WRF/runs/met_only_test
If you want to rerun the case later with a different setup, it is better to
recreate a new case folder with a different name.

Copy the setup scripts from here to the WRF run folder
cp /home/marelle/scripts/WRF/run/wrf-met/* ~/WRF/run/met_only_test


#--- Run WPS (WRF preprocessing system)
# WPS is made of 3 programs, that are all launched from the script
# jobscript_wps.sh.
# 1- geogrid.exe, this creates the WPS grid files geo_em.d??.nc describing the
# model grids.
# 2- ungrib.exe, this converts global meteorological model data from the GRIB
# format to an intermediate file format (FILE:* files) that WPS can read.
# 3- metgrid.exe, this takes geo*nc and FILE:* files and combines them to create
# WRF met input NetCDF files, met_em.d0*

Open the WPS namelist (namelist.wps.YYYY) and the WPS jobscript
(jobscript_wps.sh) and make sure that the options and input parameters are
correct. jobscript_wps.sh automates a lot of the running of WPS, I recommend
taking some time to look into the jobscript to understand what it is doing.

Run WPS.
sbatch jobscript_wps.sh
You can check how WPS is going by opening the .log files written in the run
(scratch) directory. During the execution of the script, geo_em*, FILE:*, then
met_em* files should be created. 

Check that the WPS output files are produced properly. The output folder in
/data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT should contain met_em files and geo_em
files. You can check the content of the files with the command:
ncview met_em.d0* &


#--- Run real.exe (WRF input and boundary preprocessor) 
# real.exe is another preprocessor for WRF. It needs to run after WPS and
# produces the NetCDF files wrfinput_d* (initial conditions), wrfbdy_d* (boundary
# conditions), and the optional files wrffdda_d* (nudging fields for guiding
# model projections) and wrflowinp_d* (lower boundary condition fields at
# surface such as SST and sea ice cover)

Open the real.exe and WRF namelist (namelist.input.YYYY) and the real.exe
jobscript (jobscript_real.sh) and make sure that the options and input
parameters are correct. The domain properties (resolution, size...) and the
jobscript CASENAME should not change between WPS and real.exe

Run real.exe
sbatch jobscript_real.sh
You can check how real is going in the rsl.error.0000 file written in
the run (scratch) directory.

Check that the files are produced properly. The output folder in
/data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT should contain wrfinput_d* and wrfbdy_d* files
at least. You can check the files with the command:
ncview wrfinput_d01 &


#---- Run wrf.exe (WRF model)
# wrf.exe is the executable for the WRF model

Open the real.exe and WRF namelist (namelist.input.YYYY) and the WRF jobscript
(jobscript_wrf.sh) and make sure that the options and input parameters are
correct. In almost all cases, namelist options should not change between
real.exe and wrf.exe

Run wrf.exe
sbatch jobscript_wrf.sh
You can check how the simulation is going in the rsl.error.0000 file written in
the run directory, or the wrfout_d* files as they are being produced.

Check that the files are produced properly. The output folder in
/data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT should contain wrfout_d01* files
at least. You can check the files with the command:
ncview wrfout_d01* &

Congratulations, you completed the WRF test run!

You can experiment by changing the domain size, resolution, or lat/lon center
in namelist.wps (&geogrid section) and namelist.input (&domains section).
Careful, the parameters should be consistent between the 2 namelists.

If you change the domain size or resolution, fdda parameters xwavenum and
ywavenum need to be changed, as well as time step, and total memory in
jobscripts.
