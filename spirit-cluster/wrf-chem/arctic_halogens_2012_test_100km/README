#---- Instructions for running a WRFChem4 Arctic simulation on spirit with
# SAPRC99-MOSAIC-AQ-8bin-VBS-HALOGENS chemistry/aerosols
#
# Louis Marelle, 2022/12/05
#

This runs a low-resolution (100 km) Arctic WRF-Chem simulation for 2012-03-01
to 2012-03-02, with SAPRC-MOSAIC gas-phase+aerosol including halogens. The
domain used is the same as in the original WRF-Chem-halogen publication
(https://doi.org/10.1029/2020MS002391)

# The WRF-Chem model is run in 4 main steps. First, WPS (the WRF preprocessing
# system), then real.exe (program creating the main wrf input and boundary
# files), then additional WRF-Chem preprocessors for emissions and boundary
# conditions, then wrf.exe (the WRF-Chem model). How to run these programs is
# explained below.
#
# Before running this test case, you need to compile the following programs, or a
# compiled version of these programs need to be copied to your own space:
# - WRF-Chem model (WRF model with chemistry and halogens enabled)
#   - To compile with halogens, follow the compilation guide in
#     WRF-compile-scripts and replace "git checkout develop_polar" by
#     "git checkout dev/halogens" before compilation
# - WPS (WRF preprocessor) compiled for your WRF version
# - WRF-Chem preprocessors (mozbc, wesely, exo_coldens, megan_bio_emiss, fire_emis)
# You can find compilation instructions in WRF-compile-scripts

Create a directory for storing WRF output on your /data/ space, for example
 mkdir /data/$(whoami)/WRF
 mkdir /data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT

Also create a directory for the WRF run on your home. Setup files, namelists
and scripts should be kept in a new folder for each run and kept after the run,
so that the run is reproducible later and the setup is documented. On spirit,
it is better to keep the scripts on your home ~/ since it is backed up, /data/
is not.
 mkdir ~/WRF
 mkdir ~/WRF/runs
 mkdir ~/WRF/runs/<casename>
If you want to rerun the case later with a different setup, it is better to
recreate a new case folder with a different name.

Copy the setup scripts from here to the WRF run folder
 cp <path_to_this_test_case>/* ~/WRF/run/<casename>/


#--- Run WPS (WRF preprocessing system)
Run WPS.
 sbatch jobscript_wps.sh
You can check how WPS is going by opening the .log files written in the run
(scratch) directory. During the execution of the script, geo_em*, FILE:*, then
met_em* files should be created.

Check that the WPS output files are produced properly. The output folder in
/data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT should contain met_em files and geo_em
files. You can check the content of the files with the command:
ncview met_em.d0* &

#--- Run real.exe (WRF input and boundary preprocessor) + additional WRF-Chem preprocessors
Run real.exe
 sbatch jobscript_real.sh
You can check how real.exe is doing in the rsl.error.0000 file written in the
run (scratch) directory.

Check that the files are produced properly. The output folder in
/data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT/real_<casename> should contain wrfinput_d*,
wrfbdy_d*, wrflowinp_d*, wrffdda_d*, wrfchemi_d*, wrf_season_wes_usgs_d*,
exo_coldens_d* files. You can check the files with the command:
ncview wrfinput_d01 &
You can check variables MLAI (monthly leaf area index for bio emissions) and
bc_a01 (bin 1 BC aerosol concentrations), which should display non-uniform data.
You can also check all the .out output log files to make sure the preprocessors
completed normally.

#---- Run wrf.exe (WRF-Chem model)
Run wrf.exe
 sbatch jobscript_wrfchem.sh
You can check how the simulation is going in the rsl.error.0000 file written in
the run (scratch) directory, or in the wrfout_d* files as they are being
produced.

At the end of the run, check that the output files are produced properly. The
output folder in /data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT should contain wrfout_d01*
files at least. You can check the files with the command:
ncview wrfout_d01* &

# Technical remarks and to-do list:
#  - TODO Add the additional seaice preprocessor info, not used for now
#  - TODO Re-include KFCuP, disabled for now
