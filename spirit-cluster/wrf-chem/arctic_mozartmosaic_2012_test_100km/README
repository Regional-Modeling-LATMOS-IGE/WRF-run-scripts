#---- Instructions for running a WRF-Chem4 Arctic simulation on spirit with
# MOZART-MOSAIC-AQ-4bin chemistry/aerosols

This runs a low-resolution (100 km) quasi-hemispheric Arctic WRF-Chem
simulation for 2012-02-15 to 2012-02-16, with the MOZART-MOSAIC
gas-phase+aerosol

# WRF-Chem is the Weather Research and Forecasting model, including chemistry.
# It is a 3D, limited-area (regional) model used for weather forecasts,
# long-term regional climate projections, air-quality forecasts and
# atmospheric process studies.

# 
# The WRF-Chem model is run in 4 main steps. First, WPS (the WRF preprocessing
# system), then real.exe (program creating the main wrf input and boundary
# files), then additional WRF-Chem preprocessors for emissions and boundary
# conditions, then wrf.exe (the WRF-Chem model). How to run these programs is
# explained below.
# 
# Before running this test, the WRF model (with chemistry enabled) and WPS need
# to be compiled (see instructions in ../../compilation/), or a compiled
# version of the model needs to be copied to your own space.
# I also recommend going through the WRF online tutorial before running this
# test, to better understand how the model works. I also recommend running my
# WRF met-only test run without the chemistry.

Create a directory for storing WRF output on your /data/ space, for example
 mkdir /data/$(whoami)/WRF
 mkdir /data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT

Also create a directory for the WRF run on your home. Setup files, namelists
and scripts should be kept in a new folder for each run and kept after the run,
so that the run is reproducible later and the setup is documented. On spirit,
it is better to keep the scripts on your home ~/ since it is backed up, /data/
is not.
 mkdir ~/WRF
 mkdir ~/WRF/runs
 mkdir ~/WRF/runs/<casename>
If you want to rerun the case later with a different setup, it is better to
recreate a new case folder with a different name.

Copy the setup scripts from here to the WRF run folder
 cp <path_to_this_test_case>/* ~/WRF/run/<casename>/


#--- Run WPS (WRF preprocessing system)
# WPS is made of 3 programs, that are all launched from the script
# jobscript_wps.sh.
# 1- geogrid.exe, this creates the WPS grid files geo_em.d??.nc describing the
# model grids.
# 2- ungrib.exe, this converts global meteorological model data from the GRIB
# format to an intermediate file format (FILE:* files) that WPS can read.
# 3- metgrid.exe, this takes geo*nc and FILE:* files and combines them to create
# WRF met input NetCDF files, met_em.d0*

Open the WPS namelist (namelist.wps.YYYY) and the WPS jobscript
(jobscript_wps.sh) and make sure that the options and input parameters are
correct. jobscript_wps.sh automates a lot of the running of WPS, I recommend
taking some time to look into the jobscript to understand what it is doing.

Run WPS.
 sbatch jobscript_wps.sh
You can check how WPS is going by opening the .log files written in the run
(scratch) directory. During the execution of the script, geo_em*, FILE:*, then
met_em* files should be created. 

Check that the WPS output files are produced properly. The output folder in
/data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT should contain met_em files and geo_em
files. You can check the content of the files with the command:
ncview met_em.d0* &


#--- Run real.exe (WRF input and boundary preprocessor) + additional WRF-Chem preprocessors
# real.exe is another preprocessor for WRF. It needs to run after WPS and
# produces the NetCDF files wrfinput_d* (initial conditions), wrfbdy_d* (boundary
# conditions), and the optional files wrffdda_d* (nudging fields for guiding
# model projections) and wrflowinp_d* (lower boundary condition fields at
# surface such as SST and sea ice cover)

Open the real.exe and WRF namelist (namelist.input.YYYY) and the real.exe +
preprocessor jobscript (jobscript_real.sh) and make sure that the options and
input parameters are correct. The domain properties (resolution, size...) and
the jobscript CASENAME should not change between WPS and real.exe

You can also check all the .inp files for the input setup of each preprocessor.
The fire emission preprocessor (fire_emis) and the CAM-Chem boundary conditions
(mozbc) rely on external data. In order to change the dates of this simulation
or to run in the Southern Hemisphere you need to redownload the data for your
case from:
https://www.acom.ucar.edu/cam-chem/cam-chem.shtml
and
https://www.acom.ucar.edu/Data/fire/

Run real.exe
 sbatch jobscript_real.sh
You can check how real.exe is doing in the rsl.error.0000 file written in the
run (scratch) directory.

#TODO complete the list and explain what they are for:
Check that the files are produced properly. The output folder in
/data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT/real_<casename> should contain wrfinput_d*,
wrfbdy_d*, wrflowinp_d*, wrffdda_d*, wrfchemi_d*, wrf_season_wes_usgs_d*,
exo_coldens_d* files. You can check the files with the command:
ncview wrfinput_d01 &
You can check variables MLAI (monthly leaf area index for bio emissions) and
bc_a01 (bin 1 BC aerosol concentrations), which should display non-uniform data.
You can also check all the .out output log files to make sure the preprocessors
completed normally.


#---- Run wrf.exe (WRF-Chem model)
# wrf.exe is the executable for the WRF/WRF-Chem model

Open the WRF-Chem namelist (namelist.input.YYYY) and the WRF-Chem jobscript
(jobscript_wrfchem.sh) and make sure that the options and input parameters are
correct. In almost all cases, namelist options should not be changed between
real.exe and wrf.exe

Here we run WRF-Chem with MOZART gas-phase chemistry and MOSAIC
aerosols (a setup called MOZART-MOSAIC). The main options for chemistry
and emissions that need to be set for MOZART-MOSAIC are the following:
 chem_opt                            = 202, 
 emiss_opt                           = 10,
 emiss_inpt_opt                      = 102, 
 biomass_burn_opt                    = 2,

Run wrf.exe
 sbatch jobscript_wrfchem.sh
You can check how the simulation is going in the rsl.error.0000 file written in
the run (scratch) directory, or in the wrfout_d* files as they are being
produced.

At the end of the run, check that the output files are produced properly. The
output folder in /data/$(whoami)/WRF/WRF_OUTPUT should contain wrfout_d01*
files at least. You can check the files with the command:
ncview wrfout_d01* &

Congratulations, you completed the WRF-Chem test run!
You can experiment by changing the domain size, resolution, or lat/lon center
in namelist.wps (&geogrid section) and namelist.input (&domains section).
Careful, the parameters should be consistent between the 2 namelists. You might
need to download additional input data if you change some of these settings.

#---- Run WPS, real, and WRF-Chem in a single step
If you are sure that all scripts work and will complete without a bug, you can
also launch all 3 steps in a row with the following slurm commands:
 wpsid=$(sbatch --parsable jobscript_wps.sh)
 realid=$(sbatch --parsable --dependency=afterany:$wpsid jobscript_real.sh)
 sbatch --dependency=afterany:$realid jobscript_wrfchem.sh
Each command returns the jobid, which is then used in the following command to
tell the namescript to wait for the previous job to complete
(--dependency=afterany:<job id>)


#---- Run a WRF-Chem restart
TODO, but check jobscript_wrfchem_restart.sh
