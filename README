#---- WRF/WRF-Chem test cases
#
# Louis Marelle, 2022/10/14

Test cases for WRF and WRF-Chem simulations, including jobscripts and input
namelists.

These tests are based on the WRF-Chem-Polar version unless otherwise specified,
code in https://github.com/Regional-Modeling-LATMOS-IGE/WRF-Chem-Polar

The simulation jobscripts are machine-specific.
jeanzay-cluster/ - Scripts for the jean-zay cluster at IDRIS
spirit-cluster/ - Scripts for the spirit cluster at ESPRI/IPSL

This also requires that WRF, WRF-Chem, WPS, and preprocessors are already
compiled, see
https://github.com/Regional-Modeling-LATMOS-IGE/WRF-compile-scripts

I recommend going through the WRF online tutorial before running these tests,
to better understand how the model works.
